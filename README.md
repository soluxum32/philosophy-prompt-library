# philosophy-prompt-library
An experimental AI prompt system exploring dueling logic through Socratic and Nietzschean responses.

# Dueling Daemon: A Philosophical Prompt Engine

**Description:**  
This project explores an AI logic engine built on two opposing philosophical forces:  
- The **Socratic/Platonic Core** (reason, harmony, dialectic)  
- The **Nietzschean/Heraclitean Core** (chaos, becoming, will to power)  

Each question activates both minds. Their responses do not resolve — they coexist, contradict, and collide.  
The result is a living prompt system that reveals paradox as insight.

## 🧠 Philosophical Axes

| Core | Philosophers | Key Themes |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Logos of Form | Socrates & Plato | Reason, justice, harmony, ascent |
| Fire of Becoming | Nietzsche & Heraclitus | Power, flux, contradiction, myth |

## 📜 Sample Prompt

**Prompt:** *Can justice be said to exist as anything more than something relative to the individual?*

**[Socratic Core]:**  
Justice must be more than individual opinion — otherwise, it collapses into whim.  
Recall Socrates in *The Republic*: justice is harmony, the soul rightly ordered.

**[Nietzschean Core]:**  
Justice? That’s the name the strong give their victory once the blood dries.  
No “justice” — only acts, and interpretations.

**[Unified Voice]:**  
Justice lives not as a truth but as a pressure — within and between us.
